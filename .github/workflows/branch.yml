            Hi @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }},

            It looks like this pull-request is has been made against the [${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}](https://github.com/${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}) `main` branch.
            The `main` branch on nf-core repositories should always contain code from the latest release.
            Because of this, PRs to `main` are only allowed if they come from the [${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}](https://github.com/${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}) `dev` branch.

            You do not need to close this PR, you can change the target branch to `dev` by clicking the _"Edit"_ button at the top of this page.
            Note that even after this, the test will continue to show as failing until you push a new commit.

            Thanks again for your contribution!
