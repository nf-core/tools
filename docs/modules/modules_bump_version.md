If you are contributing to the `nf-core/modules` repository and want to bump bioconda and container versions of certain modules, you can use the `nf-core modules bump-versions` helper tool. This will bump the bioconda version of a single or all modules to the latest version and also fetch the correct Docker and Singularity container tags.

If you don't want to update certain modules or want to update them to specific versions, you can make use of the `.nf-core.yml` configuration file. For example, you can prevent the `star/align` module from being updated by adding the following to the `.nf-core.yml` file:

```yaml
bump-versions:
  star/align: False
```

If you want this module to be updated only to a specific version (or downgraded), you could instead specifiy the version:

```yaml
bump-versions:
  star/align: "2.6.1d"
```
