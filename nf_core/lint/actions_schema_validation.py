    nf-core pipelines use GitHub actions workflows to run CI tests, check formatting and also linting, among others.
    These workflows are defined by ``yml`` scripts in ``.github/workflows/``. This lint test verifies that these scripts are valid
    by comparing them against the `JSON schema for GitHub workflows <https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow>`_.

    To pass this test, make sure that all your workflows contain the required properties ``on`` and ``jobs`` and that
    all other properties are of the correct type, as specified in the schema (link above).
