    """Check for template placeholders.

    The ``nf-core create`` pipeline template uses
    `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/>`_ behind the scenes.

    This lint test fails if any Jinja template variables such as
    ``{{ pipeline_name }}`` are found in your pipeline code.

    Finding a placeholder like this means that something was probably copied and pasted
    from the template without being properly rendered for your pipeline.

    This test ignores any double-brackets prefixed with a dollar sign, such as
    ``${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}`` as these placeholders are used in GitHub Actions workflows.

    .. tip:: You can choose to ignore lint test tests by editing the file called
        ``.nf-core.yml`` in the root of your pipeline and setting the test to false:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            lint:
                template_strings: False

        To disable this test only for specific files, you can specify a list of file paths to ignore.
        For example, to ignore a pdf you added to the docs:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            lint:
                template_strings:
                    - docs/my_pdf.pdf
