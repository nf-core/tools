  help: |
    Nf-core provides a set of Continuous Integration (CI) tests for Github.
    When you open a pull request (PR) on your pipeline repository, these tests will run automatically.

    There are different types of tests:
    * Linting tests check that your code is formatted correctly and that it adheres to nf-core standards
        For code linting they will use [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
    * Pipeline tests run your pipeline on a small dataset to check that it works
        These tests are run with a small test dataset on GitHub and a larger test dataset on AWS
    * Marking old issues as stale

  help: |
    Nf-core pipelines are configured to use a copy of the most common reference genome files.

    By selecting this option, your pipeline will include a configuration file specifying the paths to these files.

    The required code to use these files will also be included in the template.
    When the pipeline user provides an appropriate genome key,
    the pipeline will automatically download the required reference files.

    For more information about reference genomes in nf-core pipelines,
    see the [nf-core docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/reference_genomes).

    Nf-core has a repository with a collection of configuration profiles.

    Those config files define a set of parameters which are specific to compute environments at different Institutions.
    They can be used within all nf-core pipelines.
    If you are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly it is a good idea to use or create a custom config file for your organisation.

  help: |
    Pipelines include code linters to check the formatting of your code in order to harmonize code styles between developers.
    Linters will check all non-ignored files, e.g., JSON, YAML, Nextlow or Python files in your repository.
    The available code linters are:

    - pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/): used to run all code-linters on every PR and on ever commit if you run `pre-commit install` to install it in your local repository.
    - editor-config (https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker): checks rules such as indentation or trailing spaces.
    - prettier (https://github.com/prettier/prettier): enforces a consistent style (indentation, quoting, line length, etc).
