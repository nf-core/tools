markdown_ci = """
Nf-core provides a set of Continuous Integration (CI) tests for Github.
When you open a pull request (PR) on your pipeline repository, these tests will run automatically.

There are different types of tests:
* Linting tests check that your code is formatted correctly and that it adheres to nf-core standards
    For code linting they will use [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
* Pipeline tests run your pipeline on a small dataset to check that it works
    These tests are run with a small test dataset on GitHub and a larger test dataset on AWS
* Marking old issues as stale
"""

markdown_badges = """
The pipeline `README.md` will include badges for:
* AWS CI Tests
* Zenodo DOI
* Nextflow
* Conda
* Docker
* Singularity
* Launching on Nextflow Tower
"""

markdown_configuration = """
Nf-core has a repository with a collection of configuration profiles.

Those config files define a set of parameters which are specific to compute environments at different Institutions.
They can be used within all nf-core pipelines.
If you are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly it is a good idea to use or create a custom config file for your organisation.

For more information about nf-core configuration profiles, see the [nf-core/configs repository](https://github.com/nf-core/configs)
"""

markdown_code_linters = """
Pipelines include code linters to check the formatting of your code in order to harmonize code styles between developers.
Linters will check all non-ignored files, e.g., JSON, YAML, Nextlow or Python files in your repository.
The available code linters are:

- pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/): used to run all code-linters on every PR and on ever commit if you run `pre-commit install` to install it in your local repository.
- editor-config (https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker): checks rules such as indentation or trailing spaces.
- prettier (https://github.com/prettier/prettier): enforces a consistent style (indentation, quoting, line length, etc).
