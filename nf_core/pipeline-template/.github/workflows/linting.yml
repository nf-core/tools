            ## Python linting (`ruff`) is failing

            To keep the code consistent with lots of contributors, we run automated code consistency checks.
            To fix this CI test, please run:

            * Install [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): `pip install ruff`
            * Fix formatting errors in your pipeline: `ruff check --fix .` and `ruff format .`

            Once you push these changes the test should pass, and you can hide this comment :+1:

            We highly recommend setting up Ruff in your code editor so that this formatting is done automatically on save. Ask about it on Slack for help!

            Thanks again for your contribution!
