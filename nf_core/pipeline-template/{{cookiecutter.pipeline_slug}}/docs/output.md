This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

## Pipeline overview
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
and processes data using the following steps:

* [FastQC](#fastqc) - read quality control
* [MultiQC](#multiqc) - aggregate report, describing results of the whole pipeline

## FastQC
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, the per base sequence content (%T/A/G/C). You get information about adapter contamination and other overrepresented sequences.

For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

**Output directory: `results/fastqc`**

* `sample_fastqc.html`
  * FastQC report, containing quality metrics for your untrimmed raw fastq files
* `zips/sample_fastqc.zip`
  * zip file containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images

## MultiQC
[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualisation tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in within the report data directory.

**Output directory: `results/multiqc`**

* `Project_multiqc_report.html`
  * MultiQC report - a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser
* `Project_multiqc_data/`
  * Directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline
