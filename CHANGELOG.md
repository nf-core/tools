- Use markdown syntax in the description for the meta map channels ([#2358](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2358))

### Download

- Introduce a `--tower` flag for `nf-core download` to obtain pipelines in an offline format suited for [seqeralabs® Nextflow Tower](https://cloud.tower.nf/) ([#2247](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2247)).
- Refactored the CLI for `--singularity-cache` in `nf-core download` from a flag to an argument. The prior options were renamed to `amend` (container images are only saved in the `$NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`) and `copy` (a copy of the image is saved with the download). `remote` was newly introduced and allows to provide a table of contents of a remote cache via an additional argument `--singularity-cache-index` ([#2247](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2247)).
- Refactored the CLI parameters related to container images. Although downloading other images than those of the Singularity/Apptainer container system is not supported for the time being, a generic name for the parameters seemed preferable. So the new parameter `--singularity-cache-index` introduced in [#2247](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2247) has been renamed to `--container-cache-index` prior to release ([#2336](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2336)).
- To address issue [#2311](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/2311), a new parameter `--container-library` was created allowing to specify the container library (registry) from which container images in OCI format (Docker) should be pulled ([#2336](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2336)).
- Container detection in configs was improved. This allows for DSL2-like container definitions inside the container parameter value provided to process scopes [#2346](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2346).
- Add apptainer to the list of false positive container strings ([#2353](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/2353)).

- Update linting to check that `.editorconfig` is there and `.yamllint.yml` isn't.

## [v2.3.1 - Mercury Vulture Formatting](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.3.1) - [2022-03-23]

This patch release is primarily to address problems that we had in the v2.3 release with code linting.
Instead of resolving those specific issues, we chose to replace the linting tools (`markdownlint`, `yamllint`) with a new tool: [_Prettier_](https://prettier.io)

This is a fairly major change and affects a lot of files. However, it will hopefully simplify future usage.
Prettier can auto-format many different file formats (for pipelines the most relevant are markdown and YAML) and is extensible with plugins ([Nextflow](https://github.com/nf-core/prettier-plugin-nextflow), anyone?).
It tends to be a bit less strict than `markdownlint` and `yamllint` and importantly _can fix files for you_ rather than just complaining.

The sync PR may be a little big because of many major changes (whitespace, quotation mark styles etc).
To help with the merge, _**we highly recommend running Prettier on your pipeline's codebase before attempting the template merge**_.
If you take this approach, please copy `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc.yml` from the template to your pipeline root first,
as they configure the behaviour of Prettier.

To run Prettier, go to the base of the repository where `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc.yml` are located.
Make sure your `git status` is clean so that the changes don't affect anything you're working on and run:

```bash
prettier --write .
```

This runs Prettier and tells it to fix any issues it finds in place.

Please note that there are many excellent integrations for Prettier available, for example VSCode can be set up to automatically format files on save.

### Template

- Replace `markdownlint` and `yamllint` with [_Prettier_](https://prettier.io) for linting formatting / whitespace ([#1470](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/1470))
- Add CI test using `editorconfig-checker` for other file types to look for standardised indentation and formatting ([#1476](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/1476))

- Update bundled module wrappers to latest versions ([#1462](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/1462))
- Renamed `assets/multiqc_config.yaml` to `assets/multiqc_config.yml` (`yml` not `yaml`) ([#1471](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/1471))

## [v1.13 - Copper Crocodile](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/1.13) - [2021-03-18]

### Template

- **Major new feature** - Validation of pipeline parameters [[#426]](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/426)
  - The addition runs as soon as the pipeline launches and checks the pipeline input parameters two main things:
    - No parameters are supplied that share a name with core Nextflow options (eg. `--resume` instead of `-resume`)
    - Supplied parameters validate against the pipeline JSON schema (eg. correct variable types, required values)
  - If either parameter validation fails or the pipeline has errors, a warning is given about any unexpected parameters found which are not described in the pipeline schema.
  - This behaviour can be disabled by using `--validate_params false`
- Added profiles to support the [Charliecloud](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) and [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) container engines [[#824](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/824)]
  - Note that Charliecloud requires Nextflow version `v21.03.0-edge` or later.
- Profiles for container engines now explicitly _disable_ all other engines [[#867](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/867)]
- Fixed typo in nf-core-lint CI that prevented the markdown summary from being automatically posted on PRs as a comment.
- Changed default for `--input` from `data/*{1,2}.fastq.gz` to `null`, as this is now validated by the schema as a required value.
- Removed support for `--name` parameter for custom run names.
  - The same functionality for MultiQC still exists with the core Nextflow `-name` option.
- Added to template docs about how to identify process name for resource customisation
- The parameters `--max_memory` and `--max_time` are now validated against a regular expression [[#793](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/793)]
  - Must be written in the format `123.GB` / `456.h` with any of the prefixes listed in the [Nextflow docs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#memory)
  - Bare numbers no longer allowed, avoiding people from trying to specify GB and actually specifying bytes.
- Switched from cookiecutter to Jinja2 [[#880]](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/880)
- Finally dropped the wonderful [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) library that was behind the first pipeline template that led to nf-core [[#880](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/880)]
  - Now rendering templates directly using [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/), which is what cookiecutter was doing anyway

### Modules

Initial addition of a number of new helper commands for working with DSL2 modules:

- `modules list` - List available modules
- `modules install` - Install a module from nf-core/modules
- `modules remove` - Remove a module from a pipeline
- `modules create` - Create a module from the template
- `modules create-test-yml` - Create the `test.yml` file for a module with md5 sums, tags, commands and names added
- `modules lint` - Check a module against nf-core guidelines

You can read more about each of these commands in the main tools documentation (see `README.md` or <https://nf-co.re/tools>)

### Tools helper code

- Fixed some bugs in the command line interface for `nf-core launch` and improved formatting [[#829](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/829)]
- New functionality for `nf-core download` to make it compatible with DSL2 pipelines [[#832](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/832)]
  - Singularity images in module files are now discovered and fetched
  - Direct downloads of Singularity images in python allowed (much faster than running `singularity pull`)
  - Downloads now work with `$NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` so that pipelines sharing containers have efficient downloads
- Changed behaviour of `nf-core sync` command [[#787](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/787)]
  - Instead of opening or updating a PR from `TEMPLATE` directly to `dev`, a new branch is now created from `TEMPLATE` and a PR opened from this to `dev`.
  - This is to make it easier to fix merge conflicts without accidentally bringing the entire pipeline history back into the `TEMPLATE` branch (which makes subsequent sync merges much more difficult)

### Linting

- Major refactor and rewrite of pipieline linting code
  - Much better code organisation and maintainability
  - New automatically generated documentation using Sphinx
  - Numerous new tests and functions, removal of some unnecessary tests
- Added lint check for merge markers [[#321]](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/321)
- Added new option `--fix` to automatically correct some problems detected by linting
- Added validation of default params to `nf-core schema lint` [[#823](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/823)]

- Fixed bug in schema title and description validation
- Added second progress bar for conda dependencies lint check, as it can be slow [[#299](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/299)]
- Added new lint test to check files that should be unchanged from the pipeline.
- Added the possibility to ignore lint tests using a `nf-core-lint.yml` config file [[#809](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/809)]

### Template

- Finished switch from `$baseDir` to `$projectDir` in `iGenomes.conf` and `main.nf`
  - Main fix is for `smail_fields` which was a bug introduced in the previous release. Sorry about that!
- Ported a number of small content tweaks from nf-core/eager to the template [[#786](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/786)]
  - Better contributing documentation, more placeholders in documentation files, more relaxed markdownlint exceptions for certain HTML tags, more content for the PR and issue templates.

### Tools helper code

- Pipeline schema: make parameters of type `range` to `number`. [[#738](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/issues/738)]

## [v1.10 - Copper Camel](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/1.10) - [2020-07-30]

### Pipeline schema

This release of nf-core/tools introduces a major change / new feature: pipeline schema.
These are [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) files that describe all of the parameters for a given
pipeline with their ID, a description, a longer help text, an optional default value, a variable _type_
(eg. `string` or `boolean`) and more.

The files will be used in a number of places:

- Automatic validation of supplied parameters when running pipelines
  - Pipeline execution can be immediately stopped if a required `param` is missing,
    or does not conform to the patterns / allowed values in the schema.
- Generation of pipeline command-line help
  - Running `nextflow run <pipeline> --help` will use the schema to generate a help text automatically
- Building online documentation on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re)
- Integration with 3rd party graphical user interfaces

To support these new schema files, nf-core/tools now comes with a new set of commands: `nf-core schema`.

- Pipeline schema can be generated or updated using `nf-core schema build` - this takes the parameters from
  the pipeline config file and prompts the developer for any mismatch between schema and pipeline.
  - Once a skeleton Schema file has been built, the command makes use of a new nf-core website tool to provide
    a user friendly graphical interface for developers to add content to their schema: [https://nf-co.re/pipeline_schema_builder](https://nf-co.re/pipeline_schema_builder)
- Pipelines will be automatically tested for valid schema that describe all pipeline parameters using the
  `nf-core schema lint` command (also included as part of the main `nf-core lint` command).
- Users can validate their set of pipeline inputs using the `nf-core schema validate` command.

In addition to the new schema commands, the `nf-core launch` command has been completely rewritten from
scratch to make use of the new pipeline schema. This command can use either an interactive command-line
prompt or a rich web interface to help users set parameters for a pipeline run.

The parameter descriptions and help text are fully used and embedded into the launch interfaces to make
this process as user-friendly as possible. We hope that it's particularly well suited to those new to nf-core.

Whilst we appreciate that this new feature will add a little work for pipeline developers, we're excited at
the possibilities that it brings. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know either here on
GitHub or on the nf-core [`#json-schema` Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/json-schema).

### Python code formatting

We have adopted the use of the [Black Python code formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
This ensures a harmonised code formatting style throughout the package, from all contributors.
If you are editing any Python code in nf-core/tools you must now pass the files through Black when
making a pull-request. See [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## [v1.0.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/1.0.1) - [2018-07-18]

The version 1.0 of nf-core tools cannot be installed from PyPi. This patch fixes it, by getting rid of the requirements.txt plus declaring the dependent modules in the setup.py directly.

## [v1.0](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/1.0) - [2018-06-12]
